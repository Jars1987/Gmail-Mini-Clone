# GMAIL Simple Clone

This clone is simply to mimic the Gmail UI and to practice authentication using
thunk and redux tools.

In the app you can also mimic the send emails features but instead of going to
an actual email address the email will be added up to the the database and will
be shown in the email list displayed in the dashboard.

It was also a good pratice for playing arround with firebase.

See you on the next one.
